# odin-recipes

Website exercise for TOP. I will be creating a very barebones website consisting of a main page linking to several recipes. This exercise will allow me to demonstrate a basic understanding of how to lay out a page using HTML, as well as use of tags/elements (eg. <a>, <image>, <h1>). This will also be an opportunity to practice using common git features, and make routine commits.
